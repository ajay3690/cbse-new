\begin{enumerate}
	\item The coordinates of the foot of the perpendicular drawn from the point $(0,1,2)$ on th $x$-axis are given by:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $(1,0,0)$
			\item $(2,0,0)$
			\item $(\sqrt{5},0,0)$
			\item $(0,0,0)$
		\end{enumerate}
	\item If a line makes an angle of $30^{\circ}$ with the positive direction of $x$-axis, $120^{\circ}$ with the positive direction of $y$-axis, then the angle which it makes with the positive direction of $z$-axis is:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $90^{\circ}$
			\item $120^{\circ}$
			\item $60^{\circ}$
			\item $0^{\circ}$
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Find the equation of the line which bisects the line segment joining points $A(2,3,4)$ and $B(4,5,8)$ and is perpendicular to the lines $\frac{x-8}{3} = \frac{y+19}{-16} = \frac{z-10}{7}$ and $\frac{x-15}{3} = \frac{y-29}{8} = \frac{z-5}{-5}$
	\item If $A_{1}$ denotes the area of region bounded by $y^{2} = 4x$ and $x$-axis in the first quadrant and $A_{2}$ denotes the area of region bounded by $y^{2} = 4x$, $x=4$, find $A_{1} : A_{2}$.
