%\begin{enumerate}
\item An urn contains 3 red and 2 white marbles. Two marbles are drawn one by one with replacement from the urn. Find the probability distribution of the number of white balls. Also, find the mean of the number of white balls drawn.
\item A departmental store sends bills to charge its customers once a month Past experience shows that $ 70\% $ of its customers pay their first month bill in time. The store also found that the customer who pays the bill in time has the probability of 0.8 of paying in time next month and the customer who doesn't pay in time has the probability of 0.4 of paying in time the next month.

Based on the above information, answer the following question:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let  $E_1$ and $E_2$ respectively denote the event of customer paying or not paying the first month bill in time\\
Find $P(E_1),P(E_2).$
\item Let A denotes the event of customer paving some month's bill in time, then find $P(A|E_1)$ and $P(A|E_2).$
\item Find the probability of customer paying second month's bill in time.
\end{enumerate}

\item Find the probability of customer paying first month's bill in time if it is found that customer has paid the second month's bill in time
