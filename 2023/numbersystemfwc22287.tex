\begin{enumerate}

\item Prove that $ 2+\sqrt3 $ is an irrational number,given that $ \sqrt3 $ is an irrational number.

\item Find by prime factorisation the $LCM$ of the number $18180$ and $7575$. Also,find the $HCF$ of the two numbers.

\item The ratio of HCF to LCM of the least composite number and the least prime number is:

	\begin{enumerate}
	\item $1:2$
	\item $2:1$
	\item $1:1$
	\item $1:3$
\end{enumerate}
\item If $p$ and $q$ are natural numbers and $p$ is a multiple of $q$, then what is the HCF of $p$ and $q$?:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $ pq $  
\item $ p $                                        
\item $ q $                              
\item $ p+q $
\end{enumerate}  
\item
Two numbers are in the ratio $2:3$ and their $LCM$ is $180$. What is the $HCF$ of these numbers?
\item
Prove that $\sqrt{5}$ is an irrational number.
