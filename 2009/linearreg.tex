\begin{enumerate}
\item A dealer wishes to purchase a number of fans and sewing machines. He has only $\rupee~5,760$ to invest and has a space for at most 20 items.A fan costs him $\rupee~360$ and a sewing machine $\rupee~240$. His expectation is that he can sell a fan at a profit of $\rupee~22$ and a sewing machine at a profit of $\rupee~18$. Assuming that he can sell all the items that he can buy, how should he invest his money in order to maximise the profit ? Formulate this as a linear programming problem and solve it graphically.
\end{enumerate}
