\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Write the direction cosines of a line equally inclined to the three coordinates axes. 
\item 
Find the equation of the plane determined by the points $A(3, -1, 2), B(5, 2, 4)$ and $C(-1, -1, 6)$. also find the distance of the point $P(6, 5, 9)$ from the plane.
\item 
Find the area of the region included between the parabola ${y}^ {2} = x$ and the line $x + y = 2$
\item 
The length $x$ of a rectangle is decreasing at the rate of $5 cm$/minute and the width $y$ is increasing at the rate of $4 cm$/minute. When $x = 8 cm $and$ y = 6 cm$, find the rate of change of $(a)$ the perimeter,$ (b)$ the area of the rectangle.
\end{enumerate}
